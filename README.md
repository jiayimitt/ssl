Research and Writing: SSL

In this second assignment, you will write a post about SSL. It should be reasonably well researched so that your information is accurate.

When writing technical information, it's helpful to know your audience so you know what level of technical detail is required. For this post, your target audience is an average web user - someone who has noticed the little lock icon in the browser's address bar but doesn't really know what it means or what it's all about.

In your writing, provide clear, simple answers to allof the following questions:

What is SSL?
What is TLS?
How can I tell that my webpage is secure?
What does it mean to be secure?
What is encryption and why do I care?
Do the prefixes HTTP or HTTPS matter when we're talking about secure websites?
What is an SSL certificate authority?
