                        <h2>What is SSL?</h2>
                            <p>SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, is a technology used to secure the connection between a web browser 
                                and a web server. It ensures that any data transmitted between these two points is encrypted, making 
                                it difficult for attackers to intercept or tamper with the information. When you see a lock icon in 
                                your browser's address bar, it means that the website you're visiting uses SSL (or its successor, TLS)
                                to protect your data, like passwords or credit card numbers.
                            </p>

                        <h2>What is TLS?</h2>
                            <p>
                                TLS, or Transport Layer Security, is the modern version of SSL. In fact, SSL has been largely 
                                replaced by TLS due to its more robust security features. TLS offers the same functionality as 
                                SSL—encrypting data and ensuring secure communication—but it is considered more secure and efficient. 
                                When people talk about SSL today, they often mean TLS, but the name SSL is still widely recognized.
                            </p>

                       
                
                        <h2>How Can I Tell That My Webpage is Secure?</h2>
                            <p>
                                To check if a webpage is secure, look for a lock icon next to the website's URL in your browser's 
                                address bar. Additionally, if the URL begins with https:// instead of http://, it means the website
                                is using encryption to protect your data. Modern browsers may also give you warnings when you're 
                                visiting an insecure website.
                            </p>

                        <h2>What Does It Mean to Be Secure?</h2>
                            <p>
                                When a website is "secure," it means that the information exchanged between you and the site is encrypted. 
                                This prevents unauthorized parties, like hackers, from reading or altering the data. A secure website ensures
                                privacy and data integrity, protecting sensitive information like login credentials and financial 
                                transactions.
                            </p>

                        <h2>What is Encryption and Why Do I Care?</h2>
                            <p>
                                Encryption is the process of converting data into a code to prevent unauthorized access. In the context of SSL/TLS,
                                encryption ensures that any information sent between your browser and a website remains private. Even if a hacker
                                intercepts the data, it will appear as gibberish without the proper decryption key. You should care about 
                                encryption because it protects your personal and financial information when you're online, making it much 
                                harder for cybercriminals to steal your data.
                            </p>
                        
                        <h2>Do the Prefixes HTTP or HTTPS Matter?</h2>
                            <p>
                                Yes, the prefixes HTTP and HTTPS are crucial for understanding website security. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer 
                                Protocol) is an unsecured protocol, meaning data is transmitted in plain text, which can be intercepted 
                                easily. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) adds a layer of encryption via SSL/TLS, ensuring that
                                the information you send and receive is secure. Always prefer websites that use HTTPS, especially when 
                                entering sensitive information.
                            </p>

                        <h2>What is an SSL Certificate Authority?</h2>
                            <p>
                                An SSL certificate authority (CA) is a trusted organization responsible for issuing digital certificates 
                                that verify the identity of websites. When a website uses SSL/TLS, it needs a certificate issued by a CA 
                                to prove that it is legitimate and not a fraudulent site. Browsers trust certificates from recognized CAs,
                                which helps users confirm that they're communicating with the intended website, not an imposter.
